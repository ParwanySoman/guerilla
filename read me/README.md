## WHAT DID I USE:

I used a template to remake of the site. It is easier and handy to work with, because everything is already set up for you. You only need to change the content or add some things if you would like.


## PRICE
I would ask €300,- for the remake of the website. First of all because it is a template that I used. So most of the work was actually done. But I also worked on it for a whole day. And not to forget there will be added taxes! Some things I had to look up, because not every idea I had in mind would work. 


## CURRENT PROBLEMS & IMPROVEMENTS

- If you take a look at the site and you scroll all the way down, you will see that you can continue scrolling down, but there won't be anything to read or see. She also didn't use a footer. So I added a footer how to contact her.
    
- She put some information on the wrong place. For example she didn’t had to say much about herself so she could easily put that information on the first page. So what I did was copy information from two different sections and put them in one container. 
  
- Also in the section of “tarieven” if you scroll down, you can see that her text overlaps the information on the picture. She also leaves two rows without content. It doesn’t make sense, because why not delete the rows so it looks more clean. What I did to improve it: I took a screenshot and changed the color with Shotwell Photo Viewer. I also cropped the part where the text  would overlaps the information. I had not enough time to delete the rows. Everything important I put in one container called "information".

- I also didn’t like the lay out. Because she wrote she is a professional hair dresser, so you have to see that in her site too. So I used a template called Highlight, but I changed the background with something that would match her work, in a professional way. 

## ADDING

If I had more time I would've add maybe a picture or a logo she uses. Or the fact she stopped because of a lack of help. I also tried to add an extra container, but it didn’t came out the way I wanted. So I had to remove it. 

## DISCUSS THE CODES 

    • HTML:

        - I used images, with the <img> tag. I also changed the width and height.
        - I added a background image in the body. 
		- I added an unordered list on the footer.

    • CSS:	
		- I didn’t use CSS a lot, I only used it for the color of the texts, because its a 3000 long code and I couldn’t find my way through.
